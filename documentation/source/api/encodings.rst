Available Encodings
===================

All of the encodings available here are identical to the ones available in `ztd.text, and the documentation there gives a long list <https://ztdtext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/encodings.html>`_. The only thing that is different is that this uses function calls and, perhaps, state objects to achieve a similar effect. The ones with interesting consequences for the API shape are linked below; the rest follow a more or less identical pattern to preexisting functionality.



Special, Stateful APIs
----------------------

.. toctree::
	:maxdepth: 1
	
	encodings/punycode



Single and Multibyte Encoding APIs
----------------------------------

These APIs use :doc:`the typical cnc_mcstate_t </api/mcstate_t>` state (and may not do anything to it internally in the functions, if the API is stateless). They do not have any higher-level or special functionality associated with them.
