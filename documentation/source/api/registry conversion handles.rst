Registry-Based Conversions: Resource Handles
============================================

:cpp:type:`cnc_conversion` is first and foremost a handle to a resource. It must be opened/created like one, and destroyed like one. The ``*_new`` flavor of functions perform the allocation automatically using the :cpp:func:`associated registry's heap <cnc_registry_heap>`. The ``*_open`` flavor fo functions let the user pass in an area of memory (or probe to find out the exact area of memory) to open the handle into. The ``*_open`` flavor of functions is for particularly advanced users who want maximum control over where the type is placed and allocated and is much more complicated to use: users are recommended to use :cpp:func:`cnc_conv_new` and :cpp:func:`cnc_conv_new_n` where appropriate to save on precision handling and hassle.
