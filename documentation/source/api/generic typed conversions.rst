Generic Typed Conversions
=========================

Generic typed conversions rely on the types being put in to determine what encodings and conversions should be done. They are more flexibile when the input is generic, or the user has well-defined source and destination pointers to use with the API. The type-to-prefix/encoding mapping for this function is described in the :doc:`naming documentation </design/naming>`. When using these functions, using ``nullptr`` is ambiguous because the macro/template cannot understand what the to / from pointers should be. In those cases, cast the ``nullptr`` value with ``(CharTypeHere**)nullptr``.
