Registry Allocation
===================

At many times, the registry may need to access additional information to, for example, store extra information. This could be done with ``malloc`` and handled on cleanup with ``free``, but that can be prohibitive to C implementations which may not want to draw their memory from either of these global pools. Therefore, in order to allow a user to customize the way allocation works, there are 2 ways to customize how memory allocation is done with the library.


The first, high-level way to control all allocation is to use the :cpp:struct:`cnc_conversion_heap`. That structure provides 5 functions which will control all non-automatic storage duration space created by the registry.
