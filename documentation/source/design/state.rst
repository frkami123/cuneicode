State
=====

Occasionally, state objects are passed to the routines that perform conversions. These can do things such as hold onto shift state, have special flags for special processing (e.g., for :cpp:func:`assuming input for a given function is valid <cnc_mcstate_set_assume_valid>`). In general, the state parameter comes last and is a pointer to a state the user creates (or, if using the :doc:`typed conversion functions </api/typed conversions>`, may be created for you and used.) The function therefore usually ends up of the form:

.. code-block:: cpp

	#include <uchar.h>
	
	typedef struct my_state {
		bool assume_valid_input;
		char accumulation[2];
	} my_state;

	cnc_mcerr my_single_conversion_to_utf32(size_t* p_output_size,
		const char32_t** p_output,
		size_t* p_input_size,
		const char** p_input,
		my_state* p_state);

As described by the :doc:`indivisible unit of work </design/indivisible>`, reading input can change the state internally, even accumulate data in the state while outputting 0 characters. Because state may influence whether or not a conversion is complete (e.g., it has accumulated data inside of it and must empty it out), complex state objects should add a visible inspection function to check if the state is "complete" (has nothing left to output **and** is awaiting no further characters):

.. code-block:: cpp

	#include <uchar.h>
	
	typedef struct my_conversion_state {
		char accumulation[2];
		unsigned char accumulation_count;
		bool assume_valid_input;
	} my_conversion_state;

	bool my_state_is_complete(const my_conversion_state* p_state);

	cnc_mcerr my_single_conversion_to_utf32(size_t* p_output_size,
		const char32_t** p_output,
		size_t* p_input_size,
		const char** p_input,
		my_conversion_state* p_state);

The :cpp:union:`cnc_mcstate_t` type has a similar function named :cpp:func:`cnc_mcstate_is_complete`, used for this purpose. As a completely made up example for a complete made up encoding,
