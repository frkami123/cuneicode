Progress & Future Work
======================

This is where the status and progress of the library will be kept up to date. You can also check the `Issue Tracker <https://github.com/soasis/cuneicode/issues>`_ for specific issues and things being worked on!



More Encodings
--------------

More encodings should be supported by this library, to make development for others easier and easier. A good start with be targeting all of :term:`iconv`'s encodings first and foremost. Then, integrating new encodings as individuals voice their need for them.



Arbitrary Indirections
----------------------

Right now, encodings only traffic through the 3 well-known Unicode Encoding forms (UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32). It would be far more beneficial to allow connectivity through **any** encoding pair (but with preference shown to any Unicode encoding before taking the first go-between encoding that matches).
