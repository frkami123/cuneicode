``ztd.cuneicode``
=================

The premiere library for handling text in different encoding forms for C software.



Who Is This Library For?
------------------------

If:

- you want to convert from one Unicode encoding to another Unicode encoding;
- you want to prevent data in the wrong encoding from infiltrating your application and causing `Mojibake <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojibake>`_;
- you want to have a flexible, growable registry of encodings that does not require compile-time modification of source code to expand;
- you want a design that is better than the C Standard Library's and actually handles your encoding;
- you want safe defaults for working with text;

then ``ztd.cuneicode`` is for you!
